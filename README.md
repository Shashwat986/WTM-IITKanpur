# Lecture notes for my Python talk at Women Tech-Makers Group @ IIT Kanpur


### Clarifications:

`text8` dataset is a subset of the dataset available here:
http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata

`evolutionText.py` is taken from http://usingpython.com

`hangman.py` is taken from http://inventwithpython.com/chapter9.html

`pi.py` is taken from http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/pi-archimedes/

`notes1.py` and `notes2.py` are inspired from http://www.learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python
Much of the text has been altered, however.

All other codes are written by *Shashwat Chandra*.

### Resources:

For someone interested in learning Python, I have found the following resources to be the most helpful:

* https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/
* https://docs.python.org/2/index.html
* http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/
* http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python

For any specific modules (ex. `requests` or `BeautifulSoup`, look at the relevant documentation)
